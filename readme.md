## Inline your CSS before sending

Email is notorious for inconsistent CSS support. Therefore you should always inline your CSS and send a test to yourself before sending.

### Sending emails directly from your codebase or using a developer service?

For an API service (like Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark) **you need to inline the CSS before sending**. See `email-inlined.html` for an example.

You can use this [Email CSS Inliner](https://htmlemail.io/inline/) and then [send a test email to yourself](https://postdrop.io) to verify it works as expected.

- Copy all of email.html
- Paste the HTML as the source into the inliner
- Copy the HTML output and use this as the email template you send

### Sending emails using a marketing service like Mailchimp?

Use the template `email.html` as is. They'll put the CSS inline for you when you put together your campaign.

## Images in email

When inserting images remember to include the following attributes or risk them breaking in different clients:

- `src`
- `alt`
- `width`
- `height`
- `border`

Example:

`<img src="https://absolute-path-to-image.jpg" alt="Useful alt text" width="500" height="300" border="0" style="border:0; outline:none; text-decoration:none; display:block;">`
